New features in 1.3
-------------------

NF-13-JB15-028 Passing lists as parameters to scripts (2010-11-15)

   GNATCOLL.Scripts.Nth_Arg can now accept list parameters, in addition
   to the existing simple types.

NF-13-JB15-010 Support for python new-style classes (2010-11-15)

   GNATCOLL.Scripts will now create so called new-style classes in python.
   These are the new form of classes since Python 2.2, and provide a number
   of advantages compared to older classes: extending builtin types, better
   support for multiple-inheritance through super(), support for properties,
   support for __new__, compatibility with Python >= 3.0,...

NF-13-JB12-019 Naming parameters in Scripts.Register_Command (2010-11-17)

   When a command is exported to a scripting language, it is now possible
   to name its arguments in the Register_Command call, as opposed to doing
   it in the handler itself.

NF-13-JB05-010 New package: GNATCOLL.Refcount (2010-11-22)

   This package provides support for smart pointers and reference counted
   types. It also includes support for weak references.

NF-13-JA25-011 SQL: connect to postgreSQL without SSL (2010-11-05)

   It is now possible to specify the SSL mode when connecting to a
   postgreSQL server

NF-13-J827-012 use gnat_util.gpr to access the gnat sources (2010-11-23)

   Some optional features of GNATCOLL require access to the GNAT sources.
   You previously had to get those sources separately and create link.
   Recent versions of GNAT come with a gnat_util.gpr that makes this part
   of the setup easier, and supports applications that use both GNATCOLL and
   ASIS.

NF-13-J727-015 SQL: numbered table aliases (2010-07-30)

   In addition to the history named aliased for tables, it is now
   possible to use numbers for these aliases. This makes it easier to
   write SQL queries where a given table is used multiple times, since
   you no longer need to declare string constants for the extra names.
   In particular, this is useful for tools that automatically generate
   such queries.

NF-13-J720-017 new package GNATCOLL.Geometry (2010-07-20)

   This package provides primitive 2D operations on lines, segments,...

NF-13-I602-029 new -dbmodel switch for gnatcoll_db2ada (2010-06-25)

   This reads the description of the database schema in a text file rather
   than from a running database.

NF-13-I422-003 Projects: new API to manipulate project files (2010-03-30)

   This API gives access to parse and manipulate project files (.gpr) and
   their attributes, as well as edit project files
