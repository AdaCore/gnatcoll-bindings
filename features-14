New features in 1.4
-------------------

NF-14-K318-018 GNATCOLL.Scripts.Execute_Command returns any object (2011-03-21)

   A new function Execute_Command that directly modifies the Callback_Data
   is now provided. Through it, you can call a python function that returns
   an integer, string, boolean or a list of them, and retrieve that value
   from Ada.

NF-14-K304-012 GNATCOLL.SQL supports auto-increment fields (2011-03-03)

   When creating a database through GNATCOLL, it is now possible to
   specify that a field should be automatically incremented.

NF-14-K304-004 GNATCOLL.SQL creates database with indexes (2011-03-03)

   When creating a database through GNATCOLL (and when the schema is
   specified in a text file), it is now possible to specify indexes to
   create, to speed up queries.

NF-14-JA21-009 New package GNATCOLL.Config (2010-12-22)

   This package provides handling of configuration files, in particular
   Windows' INI files

NF-14-I606-001 GNATCOLL.SQL now supports prepared statements (2011-01-21)

   Prepared statements are precompiled statements on the DBMS server. They
   execute much faster than statements represented as strings.
   GNATCOLL now also supports parameterized queries, ie the actual values
   used in SQL_Criteria can be provided only when the query is executed.
   This makes it possible to prepare a general query, and then reuse it
   with various parameters, providing much greater speeds.
