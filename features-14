New features in 1.4
-------------------

NF-14-K304-004 GNATCOLL.SQL creates database with indexes (2011-03-03)

   When creating a database through GNATCOLL (and when the schema is
   specified in a text file), it is now possible to specify indexes to
   create, to speed up queries.

NF-14-JA21-009 New package GNATCOLL.Config (2010-12-22)

   This package provides handling of configuration files, in particular
   Windows' INI files

NF-14-I606-001 GNATCOLL.SQL now supports prepared statements (2011-01-21)

   Prepared statements are precompiled statements on the DBMS server. They
   execute much faster than statements represented as strings.
   GNATCOLL now also supports parameterized queries, ie the actual values
   used in SQL_Criteria can be provided only when the query is executed.
   This makes it possible to prepare a general query, and then reuse it
   with various parameters, providing much greater speeds.
