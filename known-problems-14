KP-14-L112-018 Traces.Syslog: storage_error on some systems

  Problem:    On some systems, sending traces to syslog results in a

KP-14-KC09-033 Project files not found on x86_64-linux

  Problem:    When installing on a 64bit linux platform, the projects
              files are copied into the wrong directory and cannot be found
              automatically by the compiler.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.5.0

  Workaround: Either set the GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable, or
              manually copy the project files from prefix/lib64/gnat/ to
              prefix/lib/gnat/.
