New features in 1.8
-------------------

NF-18-O715-002 GNATCOLL.SQL: support for "between" SQL keyword (2015-07-15)

  Support "BETWEEN" and "NOT BETWEEN" SQL syntax generation.

NF-18-O710-022 UNIQUE keyword in database schema description (2015-07-10)

  The unique constraints and indexes could be defined in the SQL database
  schema description file.

NF-18-O602-034 Projects: disable missing object dir warnings (2015-06-04)

  It is now possible to disable the "missing object dir" warnings when
  loading a project.

NF-18-O528-053 install through gprinstall (2015-07-10)

  The install is now done via gprinstall, instead of depending on complex
  shell commands in the Makefiles. This makes the system more robust, allows
  uninstalling and will work better on Windows machines.

NF-18-O523-004 Traces: variable substitution in stream names (2015-05-25)

  In the configuration file for GNATCOLL.Traces, it is now possible to set
  the name of the stream (typically a file name) by using variable
  substitution ("> name$VAR")

NF-18-O513-035 GNATCOLL.Memory: enhance memory debug capability (2015-06-01)

  GNATCOLL.Memory package uses GNAT.Debug_Pools package to add the following
  debug capabilities:
  - double free detection
  - reset content on free (fill with DEADBEEF pattern)
  - delay memory free to detect invalid memory accesses
  - report errors through stdout outputs or exceptions
  Requires GNAT.Debug_Pools from 2015 May 27 or later

NF-18-O422-013 GNATCOLL.Refcount: new package Shared_Pointers (2015-05-18)

  A new implementation for reference counted types is provided. It provides
  a more flexible API than the Smart_Pointers (since the Element_Type does
  not need to be a tagged type derived from Refcounted), and is faster,
  thanks to the use of storage pools. The API is safer since Get now returns
  a reference type rather than a direct access to the element.
  This new package is used throughout GNATCOLL, in particular GNATCOLL.SQL.
  In general, this has no effect on existing code.

NF-18-O421-027 GNATCOLL.SQL: setting a field from a SQL query (2015-06-05)

  It is now possible to build a query like
  "UPDATE table SET field = (SELECT value FROM ..)".
  Also add support for building a temporary table using the VALUES keyword.

NF-18-O128-020 sqlite upgraded to 3.8.8.1 (2015-01-28)

  GNATCOLL now comes with a newer version of sqlite, although it is still
  possible to use a sqlite from elsewhere on the system (so you can use
  specific other versions)

NF-18-O112-014 Memory: support for computing a program RSS memory (2015-01-13)

  GNATCOLL.Memory can now be used to compute the amount of memory used by
  an application (from any programming language). Furthermore, this information
  can be displayed via GNATCOLL.Traces automatically.

NF-18-N918-040 Projects: support for Runtime and Target attributes (2014-10-13)

  GNATCOLL.Projects will now take advantage of the Runtime and Target
  attributes when they are found in a project, instead of requiring this
  information to be set programmatically (presumably from the tools command
  line switches).
