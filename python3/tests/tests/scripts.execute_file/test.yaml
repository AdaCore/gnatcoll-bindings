description: test gnatcoll.scripts.execute_file
goals: |
    The test spawn a python script using the GNATCOLL.Scripts function
    Execute_File. The test is using an intermediate test.py to launch
    it in order to ensure that I/O are redirected correctly.

    Note that with Python 3.x, if GNATCOLL.Scripts.Python.Destroy is
    not called some output might be lost when stdout is not a console.
    Indeed Python 3.x buffering strategy differs from Python 2.x
