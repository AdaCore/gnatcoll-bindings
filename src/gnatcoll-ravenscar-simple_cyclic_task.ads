--  A simple archetype of a Ravenscar-compliant cyclic task. The task is meant
--  to be released at a constant time interval and to execute at
--  a contant priority level (a part when subject to the immediate priority
--  ceiling protocol).
--
--  The task timing behaviour can be analyzed with the most common timing
--  analysis techniques.
--
--  A typical example of usage is the following:
--
--  procedure Cyclic_Operation;
--  package My_Cyclic_Task is new GNATCOLL.Ravenscar.Simple_Cyclic_Task
--      (Task_Priority => 10,
--       Phase => 1_000,
--       Period => 1_000,
--       System_Start_Time => System_Properties.Start_UP_Time,
--       Cyclic_Operation => Cyclic_Operation);
--
--  The instantiation generates a cyclic task which executes at priority 10,
--  is released for the first time at System_UP_Time + Phase, executes
--  Cyclic_Operation, and suspends itself until Period milliseconds have passed
--  from the previous release.
