--  Interface to syslog.
--  These are only stubs, because syslog is not supported on this system

package GNATCOLL.Traces.Syslog is

   Stream_Syslog : constant String := "syslog";
   --  Name of the stream that can be used in GNAT.Traces configuratino files
   --  or calls to Create to send a stream to syslog.
   --  You must have called Register_Syslog_Stream (see below) first.

   --  syslog. In the current case, you can still send traces to the "syslog"
   --  stream, and that will in fact display them on the default output
   --  stream as configured in the configuration file for GNAT.Traces.
