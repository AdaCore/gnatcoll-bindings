--  This package provides a utilities to manipulate Python objects. This is not
--  meant to be very performance-efficient, but to provide an interface simpler
--  than the direct manipulation of PyObjects.

with GNATCOLL.Python; use GNATCOLL.Python;

package GNATCOLL.Any_Types.Python is

   function From_PyObject (Object : PyObject) return Any_Type;
   --  Create an Any_Type from the contents of Object. This creates copies in
   --  of any data in Object.
   --  Empty_Any_Type is returned if the underlying Python type (or its
   --  children in case of container types) is not supported.
   --  The result must be freed by the caller, by calling Free.
