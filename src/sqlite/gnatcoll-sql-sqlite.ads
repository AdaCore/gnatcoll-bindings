   --  the first connection, and then no longer touching it.
   --  Changing the setting will not impact existing connections.
   --
   --  This setting is mostly experimental, and can be tricky in your
   --  application. It is recommend that you create the transactions yourself
   --  in a controlled fashion.
   --  Otherwise, it is easy to have a deadlock in your application if one
   --  thread is using more than one connection (the first connection does a
   --  BEGIN and a SELECT and gets a shared lock, then the second connection
   --  tries to write to the database but cannot obtain a write lock).
