   procedure Set_Config_Multi_Thread;
   --  This option sets the threading mode to Multi-thread. In other words, it
   --  disables mutexing on database connection and prepared statement
   --  objects. The application is responsible for serializing access to
   --  database connections and prepared statements. But other mutexes are
   --  enabled so that SQLite will be safe to use in a multi-threaded
   --  environment as long as no two threads attempt to use the same database

   --  option enables all mutexes including the recursive mutexes on database
   --  connection and prepared statement objects. In this mode (which is the
   --  default when SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1) the SQLite
   --  library will itself serialize access to database connections and
   --  prepared statements so that the application is free to use the same
   --  database connection or the same prepared statement in different threads
   --  at the same time. If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0

   --
   --  SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL This mode blocks (calls the busy-handler
   --  callback) until there is no database writer and all readers are reading

   --  in the log file and syncs the database file. This call blocks database
   --  writers while it is running, but not database readers.
   --
   --  SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART This mode works the same way as
   --  SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_FULL, except after checkpointing the log file it
   --  blocks (calls the busy-handler callback) until all readers are reading
