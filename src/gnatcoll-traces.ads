   type Trace_Handle_Record is tagged private;
   type Trace_Handle is access all Trace_Handle_Record'Class;
   --  A handle for a trace stream.
   --  One such handle should be created for each module/unit/package where it
   --  is relevant. They are associated with a specific name and output stream,
   --  and can be activated through a configuration file. If two or more
   --  packages create streams with the same name, they will share their
   --  attributes.

   Config_File_Environment : constant String := "ADA_DEBUG_FILE";
   Default_Config_File     : constant Filesystem_String := ".gnatdebug";
   --  Name of the default configuration file. This file is looked for first in
   --  the current directory, then in the user's home directory.  If no file is
   --  found, then no handle will be activated.  The name of this file can be
   --  overriden by the environment variable Config_File_Environment, which
   --  should be an absolute name (or relative to the current directory). If
   --  this variable is set, the standard file is never searched.
   --
   --  The format of the configuration file is the following:
   --    * activating a module:
   --      MODULE_NAME=yes
   --      MODULE_NAME
   --    * deactivating a module (default)
   --      MODULE_NAME=no
   --    * redirecting all modules to a different stream:
   --      - to a file:
   --        >filename
   --        If filename is a relative path, it is relative to the location of
   --        the configuration file. $$ is automatically replaced by the
   --        process number. $D is automatically replaced by the current date.
   --        You can use >>filename instead if you want to append to the file.
   --      - to standard output
   --        >&1
   --      - to standard error
   --        >&2
   --      - to a user-defined stream (see gnat-traces-syslog.ads):
   --        >&stream
   --    * redirecting a specific module to a file
   --      MODULE_NAME=yes >filename
   --      MODULE_NAME=yes >&stream
   --    * comments
   --      -- comment
   --    * Activate traces for all modules, unless explicitely deactivated in
   --      the lines following the '+'
   --      +
   --      Note that this doesn't apply to the predefined entities (see below)
   --
   --  It is also possible to substitute a module name with a '*', to configure
   --  a whole set of modules with a single line. For instance:
   --
   --    *  *.EXCEPTIONS=yes >&stdout
   --       will always display a stream whose name ends with ".EXCEPTIONS" to
   --       stdout.
   --
   --    *  MODULE_NAME.*=no
   --       Disables all streams starting with "MODULE_NAME" (including
   --       MODULE_NAME itself). The star can only be used to substitute the
   --       whole first or last name. If the configuration file also contains
   --       a line like "MODULE_NAME.FOO" anywhere (before or after), then this
   --       specific stream is not disabled.
   --
   --  Here is a short example of configuration file:
   --     +                 --  by default, show all
   --     >&2               --  defines the default stream
   --     PKG1=no           --  do not show
   --     PKG2=yes          --  to the default stream, ie stderror
   --     PKG3=yes >file    --  to the file "file" in current directory
   --     PKG4=yes >&syslog --  to syslog, see gnat-traces-syslog.ads

   Debug_Mode : constant Boolean := True;
   --  Set the global activation status for the debug traces. If this is set to
   --  False and the subprograms below are inlined, then no code will be
   --  generated to support debug traces. Otherwise, if Debug_Mode is True,
   --  then the debug traces can be activated selectively for each module.

   type On_Exception_Mode is (Propagate, Ignore, Deactivate);
   --  Behavor when an exception is raised while writing to the log stream e.g
   --  because of NFS error when writing to a file.
   --    Propagate:  the exception is propagated
   --    Ignore:     the exception is silently ignored
   --    Deactivate: when an exception is raised when manipulating a handle
   --                deactivate it; no logging will happen on this handle
   --                anymore.

   --    - If filename is specified and exists on the disk, parse this file
   --    - Else test the file described in Config_File_Environment

   --    - If not found, search in the user's home directory for a file

   --  check whether traces should be emitted for that module. Calling this
   --  function several times with the same Unit_Name will always return the
   --  same handle.
   --
   --  If Default is not From_Config, this forces an explicit activation
   --  status for that handle. To change it, the user must explicitely have
   --  a line for this handle in the config file, and this handle is not
   --  impacted by the use of "+" in this config file.
   --
   --  Stream indicates which stream the application is sent to. This has the
   --  same format as in the configuration file:
   --     - if left to the empty string, this is the default stream specified
   --       in the configuration file on the line starting with ">".
   --     - otherwise, the string is similar to what can be specified in the
   --       configuration file after ">", ie one of "filename", "&2" (stderr),
   --       "&1" (stdout) or any of the registered streams ("&syslog" for
   --       instance, see gnat-traces-syslog.ads)
   --  If no such stream is found, defaults on the default stream declared in
   --  the config file.
   --
   --  If the handle has not been created yet in some other part of the code,
   --  a new one will be allocated. Factory can be used in this case to do the
   --  actual allocation, so that you can return your own Trace_Handle_Record,
   --  which might override some of primitive operations like the decorators.
   --  If Factory is unspecified, a standard Trace_Handle_Record is allocated.
   --
   --  If Finalize is True, the handle will be freed when Finalize is called,
   --  otherwise it won't be. The only reason to set this to False is so that
   --  the handle still exists when the application itself is being finalized
   --  by the compiler, so that you can have logs till the last minute.

   --  Recommended use with generics:
   --  Since generics might be used in various, independent modules, the
   --  recommended use is to have one more generic parameter for the trace
   --  handle. Internally, it is then possible to specialize this stream (see

   --  "DEBUG.ABSOLUTE_DATE"
   --  If this handle is activated, then the absolute date will be added to the
   --  output, if the stream supports it (syslog does not)

   --  "DEBUG.ELAPSED_TIME"
   --  If this handle is activated, then the elapsed time since the last
   --  call to Trace for this handler will be displayed.

   --  "DEBUG.STACK_TRACE"
   --  If this handle is activated, then the stack trace will be displayed.

   --  "DEBUG.LOCATION"
   --  If this is activated, then the location of the call to Trace is
   --  displayed. Note that, contrary to DEBUG.STACK_TRACE, this works on
   --  all targets, and even if the executable wasn't compiled with debug
   --  information.

   --  "DEBUG.COLORS"
   --  If this handle is activated, then the messages will use colors to
   --  separate the actual message from the information output in the
   --  stream, if the latter supports color output

   --  "DEBUG.ENCLOSING_ENTITY"
   --  If this handle is activated, the name of the enclosing entity at the
   --  location of the call to Trace will be displayed.

   --  "DEBUG.COUNT"
   --  If this handle is actived, two numbers are associated with each output
   --  trace: one of them is unique for the handle, the other is unique in the
   --  whole application life. These can for instance be used to set
   --  conditional breakpoints for a specific trace (break on traces.Log or
   --  traces.Trace, and check the value of Handle.Count

   --  "DEBUG.FINALIZE_TRACES"
   --  This handle is activated by default. If deactivated, the trace handles
   --  will never be freed when the program is finalized by the compiler. This
   --  is mostly for debugging purposes only.
