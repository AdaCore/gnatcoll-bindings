--  A simple archetype of a Ravenscar-compliant sporadic task. The task is
--  meant to enforce a minimum interelease interval and to execute at a contant
--  priority level (a part when subject to the immediate priority ceiling
--  protocol). The suspension/release mechanism is managed by a protected
--  object. In the worst case, the task behaviour is identical to the behaviour
--  of a cyclic task (GNAT.Ravenscar.Simple_Cyclic_Task) with Period =
--  Minimum_Interelease_Time.
--
--  The task timing behaviour can be analyzed with the most common timing
--  analysis techniques.
--
--  A typical example of usage is the following:
--
--  procedure Sporadic_Operation;
--  package My_Sporadic_Task is new GNATCOLL.Ravenscar.Simple_Sporadic_Task
--      (Task_Priority => 10,
--       Minimum_Interelease_Time => 1_000,
--       Protocol_Ceiling => 15,
--       System_Start_Time => System_Properties.Start_UP_Time,
--       Sporadic_Operation => Sporadic_Operation);
--
--  [...]
--  -- Release the task --
--  My_Sporadic_Task.Release;
--  [...]
--
--  The instantiation generates a sporadic task which executes at priority 10,
--  is ready to executed starting from System_UP_Time + Phase, executes
--  Sporadic_Operation, and enforce a minimum interelease time of 1000
--  milliseconds. Protocol_Ceiling is the ceiling priority of the protected
--  object managing the suspension/release mechanism of the task: the protected
--  object is accessed by both the clients (via Release) and the sporadic task
--  itself. Protocol_Ceiling must be equal to the priority of the client with
--  the highest priority, including the task itself (Task_Priority).
