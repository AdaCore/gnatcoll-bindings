--  An interface to libiconv.
--
--  For historical reasons, international text is often encoded using a
--  language or country dependent character encoding. With the advent of the
--  internet and the frequent exchange of text across countries - even the
--  viewing of a web page from a foreign country is a "text exchange" in this
--  context -, conversions between these encodings have become important. They
--  have also become a problem, because many characters which are present in
--  one encoding are absent in many other encodings. To solve this mess, the
--  Unicode encoding has been created. It is a super-encoding of all others and
--  is therefore the default encoding for new text formats like XML.
--
--  Still, many computers still operate in locale with a traditional (limited)
--  character encoding. Some programs, like mailers and web browsers, must be
--  able to convert between a given text encoding and the user's encoding.
--  Other programs internally store strings in Unicode, to facilitate internal
--  processing, and need to convert between internal string representation
--  (Unicode) and external string representation (a traditional encoding) when
--  they are doing I/O. Libiconv is a conversion library for both kinds of
--  applications.
--
--  If support for libiconv was not compiled into gnatcoll, these subprograms
--  are still available, but will return their input unmodified.
