--  This package provides storage pools that allocate enough memory for their
--  element and an extra header.
--  This header can be used to store extra information. For instance, it has
--  been used to store a reference counter, or pointers to the next element
--  in a container.
--  The goal is to reduce the number of memory allocations: instead of doing
--  one allocation for the element, and a second one for the counter, we can
--  do a single allocation, which is much faster.
--
--  Usage example:
--     type Header is record
--        Refcount : Natural;
--     end record;
--     package Pools is new Header_Pools (Header);
--     package String_Pools is new Pools.Typed (String);
--     package Integer_Pools is new Pools.Typed (Integer);
--
--     Str : String_Pools.Element_Access;
--     Str := new String'("foo");    --  uses the storage pool
--
--     String_Pools.Header_Of (Str).Refcount := 1;
