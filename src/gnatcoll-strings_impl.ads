--  This package provides the implementation for XString.
--  Ada provides several kinds of strings:
--  * A String
--    is a fixed-width string, but very fast in general. Functions returning
--    a String must do so on the secondary stack, which might be slow.
--  * A Bounded_String
--    has a known maximal size, but can represent any string smaller than this.
--    It also doesn't do any memory allocation, and therefore is fast. You
--    need one instance of the package for each size of bounded_string.
--  * An Unbounded_String
--    is a string of any size, which automatically allocates more memory when
--    needed. They are very flexible, but not very efficient.
--
--  This package provides a fourth type of string, which tries to combine the
--  advantages of all the above:
--  * Unlimited size of the string, which grows as necessary
--    More flexible than String and Bounded_String.
--  * No memory allocation for small strings (for a certain definition of
--    small, see the SSize parameter below). This means very fast handling of
--    those small strings.
--    Faster than Unbounded_String
--  * More extensive interface.
--    For instance, you can use X(1) to get the first character of the string.
--    The index always starts at 1, just like unbounded strings.
--  * Supports various character types
--
--  Like Unbounded_String, a XString should not be accessed unprotected from
--  several different tasks. We do not use locks for maximum efficiency. At
--  the same time, it is safe to pass a copy to a different thread. The
--  internal shared buffer is protected against concurrent accesses, via a
--  lock-free data structure.
--
--  When you use this package, you could be seeing memory leaks when your
--  program exits. This is because, like unbounded_string, it uses the
--  pragma Finalize_Storage_Only which means that GNAT can skip the calls to
--  free memory on exit, for performance reasons.
