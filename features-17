------------------

NF-17-P210-024 GNATCOLL.Refcount use atomic ops automatically (2016-02-10)

  The shared_pointers package will by default use atomic pointers if the
  application uses tasks, and use non-atomic pointers (more efficient)
  when the application is not using tasking. This is a default, still
  overridable by the user.
