Known Problems fixed in Gnatcoll 1.1

- H730-018: Environment variable Build interfers with builds
  Problem:    If you have set the environment variable Build to some
              value other than "Production" or "Debug", the compilation
              of Gnatcoll will fail. This is because this variable is used
              as a scenario variable in Gnatcoll's project files.
  Workaround: unset the variable before compiling Gnatcoll. This variable
              was now renamed to Gnatcoll_Build to avoid conflicts

- H711-008:   gnatcoll-traces-syslog.ad[bs] not installed on Windows
  Problem:    The Windows installer doesn't properly install the above files.
  Workaround: The missing files can be found in the src subdirectory.
