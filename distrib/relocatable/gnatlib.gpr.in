--  This is the Gnatlib project file. It can be used both for static and
--  relocatable libraries, although the two might not be available on
--  your system depending on how GnatLib was compiled.
--  You can select either of the two libraries by changing the environment
--  variable GNATLIB_KIND. The default is the last one you installed from
--  GnatLib
