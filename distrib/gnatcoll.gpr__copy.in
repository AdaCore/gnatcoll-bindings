--  This is the Gnatcoll project file. It can be used both for static and
--  relocatable libraries, although the two might not be available on
--  your system depending on how GnatColl was compiled and installed.
--  You can select either of the two libraries by changing the environment
--  variable LIBRARY_TYPE.
--  The default depends on how gnatcoll was configured and compiled (although
--  in general it will be static since this works better in most cases)
