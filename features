NF-12-I802-001 Email: support for continuation lines in headers (2009-08-10)

   Headers can include parameters (for instance Content-Disposition will
   contain a filename parameter to suggest a name). GNATCOLL now supports
   cases where these parameters are split into several lines (the filename
   parameter mentioned above can be split into filename*0, filename*1,...
   when its value is too long to fit on a single line).
