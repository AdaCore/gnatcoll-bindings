--  This package provides support for parsing the .ali and .gli files that
--  are generated by GNAT and gcc. In particular, those files contain
--  information that can be used to do cross-references for entities (going
--  from references to their declaration for instance).
--
--  A typical example would be:
--
--  declare
--     Session : Session_Type;
--  begin
--     GNATCOLL.SQL.Sessions.Setup
--        (Descr   => GNATCOLL.SQL.Sqlite.Setup (":memory:"));
--     Session := Get_New_Session;
--
--     ... parse the project through GNATCOLL.Projects
--
--     Create_Database (Session.DB);
--     Parse_All_LI_Files (Session, ...);
--   end;

with GNATCOLL.Projects;     use GNATCOLL.Projects;
with GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec;     use GNATCOLL.SQL.Exec;
with GNATCOLL.SQL.Sessions; use GNATCOLL.SQL.Sessions;
with GNATCOLL.VFS;

package GNATCOLL.ALI is

   function Parse_All_LI_Files
     (Session : Session_Type;
      Tree    : Project_Tree;
      Project : Project_Type) return Boolean;
   --  Parse all the LI files for the project, and stores them in the
   --  database.
   --  Return True if at least one LI was updated.

   procedure Create_Database
     (Connection      : access Database_Connection_Record'Class;
      DB_Schema_Descr : GNATCOLL.VFS.Virtual_File;
      Initial_Data    : GNATCOLL.VFS.Virtual_File);
   --  Create the database tables and initial contents.
   --  Behavior is undefined if the database is not empty initially.
   --  DB_Schema_Descr is the file that contains the description of the
   --  entities database schema.
   --  ??? We should not rely on an external file for this. Perhaps GNATCOLL
   --  could generate some code to create the GNATCOLL.SQL.Inspect.DB_Schema
   --  in the code ?

end GNATCOLL.ALI;
