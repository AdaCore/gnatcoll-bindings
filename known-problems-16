KP-16-MB28-001 stack usage issues with the JSON stream decoder

  Problem:    The stack usage of the JSON serializer/deserializer is too high
              when working on very large JSON string values, and JSON object's
              key values.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.7.0

  Workaround: None
