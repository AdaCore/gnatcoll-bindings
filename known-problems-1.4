KP-14-L801-020 Projects.Load fails when no explicit environment is given

  Problem:    If you do not pass an explicit environment to Load, the one that
              is created explicitly is not properly initialized. This might
              result in errors when parsing projects.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.5.0

  Workaround: Create a variable of type Project_Environment_Access, and call
              Initialize on it. Then pass it to Load.

KP-14-L429-003 JSON does not decode '\"' characters properly

  Problem:    If the JSON you pass to GNATCOLL.JSON.Read contains the sequence
              \", the latter is not properly decoded and an exception is raised
              instead.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.5.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-14-L112-018 Traces.Syslog: storage_error on some systems

  Problem:    On some systems, sending traces to syslog results in a
              storage_error.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.5.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-14-KC09-033 Project files not found on x86_64-linux

  Problem:    When installing on a 64bit linux platform, the projects
              files are copied into the wrong directory and cannot be found
              automatically by the compiler.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.5.0

  Workaround: Either set the GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable, or
              manually copy the project files from prefix/lib64/gnat/ to
              prefix/lib/gnat/.
