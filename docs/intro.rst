Introduction to the GNAT Component Collection
*********************************************

The reusable library known as the GNAT Component Collection (GNATColl)
originated in the implementation of the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS)
technology and the GNAT Tracker web-based interface and
have thus seen heavy usage in practice.
The various components deal with a range of commonly encountered 
programming issues,
including string and text processing, memory management,
and file handling, and several of the components will be
especially useful in enterprise applications.

This document explains how to build and install GNATColl and
then describes the various modules that make up the collection:

* *Scripts*: Embedding script languages

* *Traces*: Logging information

* *Memory*: Monitoring memory usage

* *Mmap*: Reading and writing files

* *Boyer-Moore*: Searching strings

* *Paragraph filling*: Formatting text

* *Templates*: Generating text

* *Email*: Processing email messages

* *Ravenscar*: Patterns for multitasking

* *Storage Pools*: Controlling memory management

* *VFS*: Manipulating files

* *Tribooleans*: Three-state logic

* *Geometry*: Primitive geometric operations

* *Projects*: Manipulating ``gpr`` files

* *Refcount*: Reference counting

* *Config*: Parsing configuration files

* *Pools*: Controlling access to resources

* *JSON*: Handling JavaScript Object Notation

* *SQL*: Database interface
