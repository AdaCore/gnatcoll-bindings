KP-11-H922-018 Installation failure on some systems

  Problem:    On systems that do not have their own install script,
              configure is falling back to ./install.sh, which does not
              work for subdirectories.

  Status:     Fixed in GNATCOLL 1.2

  Workaround: Install with "make INSTALL=cp install"

KP-11-H730-018 Environment variable Build interfers with builds

  Problem:    If you have set the environment variable Build to some
              value other than "Production" or "Debug", the compilation
              of Gnatcoll will fail. This is because this variable is used
              as a scenario variable in Gnatcoll's project files.

  Status:     Fixed in GNATCOLL 1.2

  Workaround: unset the variable before compiling Gnatcoll. This variable
              was now renamed to Gnatcoll_Build to avoid conflicts

KP-11-H711-008 gnatcoll-traces-syslog.ad[bs] not installed on Windows

  Problem:    The Windows installer doesn't properly install the above files.

  Status:     Fixed in GNATCOLL 1.2

  Workaround: The missing files can be found in the src subdirectory.
