New features in 1.3
-------------------

NF-13-J727-015 SQL: numbered table aliases (2010-07-30)

   In addition to the history named aliased for tables, it is now
   possible to use numbers for these aliases. This makes it easier to
   write SQL queries where a given table is used multiple times, since
   you no longer need to declare string constants for the extra names.
   In particular, this is useful for tools that automatically generate
   such queries.

NF-13-J720-017 new package GNATCOLL.Geometry (2010-07-20)

   This package provides primitive 2D operations on lines, segments,...

NF-13-I602-029 new -dbmodel switch for gnatcoll_db2ada (2010-06-25)

   This reads the description of the database schema in a text file rather
   than from a running database.

NF-13-I422-003 Projects: new API to manipulate project files (2010-03-30)

   This API gives access to parse and manipulate project files (.gpr) and
   their attributes, as well as edit project files
