The GNAT Components Collection

See the documentation in the docs/ directory for instructions on how
to build, install and use gnatcoll.
The documentation is either available as a precompiled HTML file, or in the file
building.rst.

To test GNATCOLL itself, you should run "make test" from the current directory,
after compiling and installing GNATCOLL.
