KP-15-M111-002 Compatibility with GtkAda 3.x

  Problem:    The API for Gtk_Tree_Model has changed slightly in GtkAda 3.x,
              and GNATCOLL.VFS.GtkAda.Get_File was not compatible. To ensure
              that GNATCOLL works with both GtkAda 2.x and 3.x, the first
              parameter of Get_File is now a Gtk_Tree_Model, rather than an
              access to Gtk_Tree_Model_Record, which might require an explicit
              cast in user code.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.

KP-15-M107-026 Stack overflow may occur when writing large JSON objects

              overflow may occur.

  Status:     Fixed in Gnatcoll 1.6.0

  Workaround: None.
